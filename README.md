# Application of Centroid Based and Density Based Clustering Techniques on a higher Dimentionality Dataset (more than two features/attributes).

Worked out the steps to apply common cluster techniques on a dataset with multiple attributes.

Centroid Based Clustering Methods used: 
1. KMeans Clustering
2. Aglomerative Clustering Technique

Density Based Clustering Method used:
1. DBSCAN - Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
